# myanimelist-custom-list-styles
Almost of bellow styles are made by forum members of MAL, i just edit some parts of the code to customize it for me.

## How to use

1. Go to your [Account settings](http://myanimelist.net/editprofile.php?go=myoptions) then [list style disign](http://myanimelist.net/ownlist/style).
2. Choose "Classic" template if you want full css customisation feature, or "Modern" template for one very estetic with some graphic customisations option like changing background etc... and full css edit. Here we will use the classic template.
3. After choosing "Classic" template, you can acces to the "Seetings" features just bellow. Choose [Advanced CSS Style Disign](http://myanimelist.net/editprofile.php?go=stylepref&do=cssadv).
4. If you don't have yet one, you can create a custom style (and one others max). Click in the new style id then in the text box bellow, copy and past the CSS code of the style you want to use and save the change by clicking in "Update CSS" button bellow. 
5. By default, the firs time you edit this, MAL will ask you if you want to use this style for your list, accept. Next time you will have to go back to "List Style Disign" then click on "Change My List Style". In the next page you can choose which style you want to use for your anime list and for your manga list. So if you have created twoo style, you can choose twoo different style for each list.

### Tips

* You can use some service like [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) or [Pastbin](http://pastebin.com/) to host your css and just the ```css @import ``` rules.
